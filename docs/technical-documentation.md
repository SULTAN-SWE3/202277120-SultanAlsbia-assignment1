# Technical Documentation

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It includes multiple sections and interactive features as required in Assignment 1.

## Project Structure
1- `index.html` → Contains the structure and content of the website.
2- `css/styles.css` → Handles styling, layout, responsive design, and dark mode.
3- `js/script.js` → Implements JavaScript interactivity (theme toggle and form handling).
4- `docs/` → Contains documentation files.
5- `assets/images/` → Stores images used in the website.
6- `.gitignore` → Prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.

## Features Implemented
1. Responsive design using CSS and media queries.
2. Dark/Light mode toggle using JavaScript and CSS classes.
3. Contact form interaction (prevents refresh and shows confirmation message).
4. Smooth scrolling using `scroll-behavior: smooth`.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. (Optional) Use VS Code with Live Server extension for better testing.

## Compatibility
The website works on modern browsers such as:
1- Google Chrome
2- Microsoft Edge
3- Firefox
4- Safari

## Performance Considerations
1- Lightweight structure (no heavy frameworks used).
2- Optimized CSS and minimal JavaScript.
3- Fast loading time across devices.
